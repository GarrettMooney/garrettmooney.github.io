Git worktrees allow you to check out multiple branches simultaneously in different directories.

## Creating a Worktree

```bash
# Create new worktree with new branch
git worktree add path/to/worktree -b branch-name

# Create worktree from existing branch
git worktree add path/to/worktree existing-branch
```

## Listing Worktrees

```bash
git worktree list
```

## Removing a Worktree

```bash
# Remove worktree directory first
rm -rf path/to/worktree

# Then prune the worktree reference
git worktree prune
```

## Use Cases

- Work on multiple features simultaneously
- Keep a clean main branch checked out for quick reference
- Test changes across different branches without stashing
