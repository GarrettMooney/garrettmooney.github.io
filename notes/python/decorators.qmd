## What are Decorators?

Decorators are a way to modify or enhance functions without changing their code directly.

## Basic Example

```python
def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Before function call")
        func()
        print("After function call")
    return wrapper

@my_decorator
def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")

say_hello()
```

## Common Use Cases

- Logging
- Authentication/authorization
- Timing functions
- Caching/memoization
