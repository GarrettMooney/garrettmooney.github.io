## Basic Syntax

```python
# Traditional approach
squares = []
for x in range(10):
    squares.append(x**2)

# List comprehension
squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]
```

## With Conditionals

```python
# Filter even numbers
evens = [x for x in range(20) if x % 2 == 0]

# Conditional expression
labels = ['even' if x % 2 == 0 else 'odd' for x in range(10)]
```

## Nested Comprehensions

```python
# Flatten a matrix
matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
flat = [num for row in matrix for num in row]
```
