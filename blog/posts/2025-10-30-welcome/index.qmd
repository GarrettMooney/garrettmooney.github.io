Welcome! This is the first post on my new Quarto-powered blog.

## What is Quarto?

[Quarto](https://quarto.org/) is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system. It's great for:

- Writing technical content with code
- Creating beautiful, responsive websites
- Supporting multiple programming languages
- Built-in search and navigation

## What to Expect

I'll be writing about:

- Software engineering practices
- Data science and analysis
- Tools and workflows
- Whatever else I find interesting

Stay tuned for more content!

## Code Example

Here's a simple Python example:

```python
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("World"))
```

This blog supports syntax highlighting for many languages out of the box.
